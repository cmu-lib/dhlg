This video discusses logistic regression as an entry point to machine learning for text and literary analysis. The video walks through how to train a model in a Google Drive spreadsheet for simplicity as well as how to run more complex logistical regressions in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) with [Python](https://www.python.org/). It also explores the results one can get when using these types of models for literary analysis.
